# @jaredallard does dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine. My dotfiles
are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my
life. My dotfiles, without me, are useless. Without my dotfiles, I am useless.

## Install

**Note**: The below script will install the 1Password CLI and chezmoi temporarily, and
then remove them. This is to make it easier to install the dotfiles, chezmoi and
the post-install script will permanently install them later.

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaredallard/dotfiles/main/setup.sh)"
```
